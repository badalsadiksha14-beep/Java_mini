How it works (step by step)

User inputs a route

The route is entered as a sequence of GPS coordinates (latitude and longitude).

These points represent the path a vehicle or person will follow.

User defines hazard zones

Hazard zones are modeled as circular regions with:

A center coordinate

A radius (in kilometers)

A risk weight (severity level)

Geospatial analysis

For each point on the route, the program:

Calculates the real Earth distance to each hazard zone using the Haversine formula.

Checks whether the route passes inside or close to any hazard zone.

Risk calculation

The system computes a risk score based on:

How many hazard zones the route intersects

How long the route stays within risky areas

The severity (weight) of those hazard zones

Risk classification

The final score is classified as:

LOW risk

MEDIUM risk

HIGH risk

Results display

The GUI shows:

Total route distance

Numerical risk score

Risk level

A textual explanation describing why the route is risky

What problem does it solve?

It helps identify unsafe routes before travel by:

Comparing routes against hazard-prone regions

Supporting safer route planning

Simulating logic used in real GIS disaster-management systems

Why this program is important

Demonstrates real geospatial reasoning, not just visualization

Uses multi-layer spatial analysis

Similar logic is used in:

Disaster response planning

Navigation systems

Logistics and infrastructure safety analysis
